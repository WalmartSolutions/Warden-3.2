*Download on Mediafire because this client is like 1Gb and GitHub is A$$*

# Why?
It's just a skidded af client. Nothing special, nothing new, nothing custom. People that bought this should straight up get a refund. The client contained a feature which screenshotted peoples desktop when launching it and also attempted to pull their Local IP too which is like... What? üò≠. This client is just skidded af like man, I can't even wrap my head around this sh1 üíÄ. Also forgot to mention that they used some HORRIBLE (can't even be called) obfuscator üôè (Sh1 was just a seethrought junkcode).
